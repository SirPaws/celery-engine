But that's not what this is, though they may share a name their differences are vast.
This is Celery a small toolkit written in C99, inspired by the olc::PixelGameEngine[^1]
created by the youtuber javid9x and Processing[^2] first initiated by Ben Fry and Casey Reas.
at this moment it is still in development and has missing features.

# Usage
As celery is inspired by Processing it has a similar interface to it

```c
#define CELERY_MAIN
#include "celery.h"

void setup(void) {
  ceSize(960, 540);
}

void draw(void) {
  const u32 width  = ceWidth();
  const u32 height = ceHeight();

  for (u32 y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    for (u32 x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      cePixel p = {.r= rand()%255,.g= rand()%255,.b= rand() % 255,.a= 255};
      ceDraw(x, y, p);
    }
  }
}
```  
this example is the minimal example, there are other functions that you can optionally define:
```c
void update(f64);
```
this function is meant for updating variables each frame
```c
void terminate(void);
```
and here's the one for termination of the program.
All of these functions are optional and will only be called if defined
